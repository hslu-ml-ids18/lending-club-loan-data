<!-- ```{r Data Loading} -->

<!-- # we might move this somewhere else and use only the prepared csv as this is time consuming -->

<!-- rownames(loan_df) <- 1:nrow(loan_df) -->

```{r Data Exploration - interest rate vs loan amount}
# plotting the loan amount vs the interest rate
plot(loan_amnt ,int_rate)
# from this visualisation we can't see any clear correlation.

plot(int_rate, loan_amnt)

```

```{r Data Exploration - interest rate vs term}
# plotting the loan amount vs the term

plot(term, int_rate)
# Here we can see that the interest rate is generaly higher for 60 months loans and lower for 36 months loans.
```

```{r Data Exploration - interest rate vs grade}
# plotting the loan amount vs the grade

plot(grade, int_rate)
# The Grade seems to have a strong influence on the interest rate
plot(sub_grade, int_rate)
# We see the same but with a greater granualrity. 

```

```{r Data Exploration - interest rate vs home ownership}
# plotting the loan amount vs home ownership

plot(home_ownership, int_rate)
# Here we can see that the interest rate is generaly higher for 60 months loans and lower for 36 months loans.
```

```{r Data Exploration - interest rate vs verification_status}
# plotting the loan amount vs verification_status

plot(verification_status, int_rate)
# The verification_status seems to also have an influence on the interest rate.
